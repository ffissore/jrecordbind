All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### [3.3.0] - 2022-07-09

##### Added

- Added support to padders and converters to elements of type `simpleType`

### [3.2.0] - 2019-07-25

##### Fixed

- When unpadding a field made only of padding char (for example spaces), padder failed to unpad. Thx @jzaratei for reporting

### [3.1.0] - 2019-07-25

##### Added

- Added support to standard XML Schema attribute `fixed` when marshalling. Previously, only the unmarshaller honoured it, so users could potentially create files which didn't
  comply
  with the xsd definition. Now, when a property has a `fixed` value, that valuw will be used, regardless of whatever value was set by users.

### [3.0.0] - 2019-07-24

##### Changed

- Minimum Java version set to 11
- Package name renamed to `org.fissore.jrecordbind`
- Copyright holder from Assist (the company) to Federico Fissore (the individual), and contributors
- Using `bindings.xjb` is now mandatory due to latext JAXB using `XMLGregorianCalendar` for `xs:date` elements
- Padders now pad AND unpad: a property value of "john   " in a text file will be unmarshalled as "john"
- Various changes in the API (both constructors and methods signature) in order to improve the overall design

##### Added

- Example module
- Support to inject converters and padders from outside, thus making JRecordBind more dependency-injection-framework-friendly

##### Removed

- Pojo module
- Many tests, whenever it was unclear what they were testing and/or the feature under test was also tested in other tests. Goal was to provide contributors a clearer test suite
- ant support
- Internal cache for padders and converters

- - -
At the beginning, no proper changelog was made, commits were not descriptive, and there were no tags. Thus, there are holes. Sorry about that.
